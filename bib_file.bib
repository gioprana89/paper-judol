Online gambling is a game that is carried out using money as a bet with the terms of the game and the amount of the bet determined by online gamblers and using electronic media with internet access as an intermediary. Online gambling is a phenomenon that cannot be denied and is found in society, especially among teenagers. They consciously know that gambling is included in deviant behavior which is considered bad by some people and is prohibited by state law, but this does not cover their interest in participating in it. This study aims to describe the behavior of teenagers who are addicted to online gambling. This research is a type of qualitative research with data analysis techniques using qualitative analysis.

abstract = {The rise of online gambling in Indonesia has emerged as a significant public health concern, driven by various psychological, social, and regulatory factors. Despite stringent laws prohibiting gambling, the accessibility and appeal of online platforms have led to increased participation, particularly among young adults. This phenomenon is characterized by a paradoxical sense of control that users feel while gambling online, which can lead to compulsive behaviors and addiction. The structural characteristics of online gambling platforms, including fast-paced games and easy accessibility, further exacerbate this issue. Social influences, particularly through social media and peer interactions, normalize gambling behaviors, making them more appealing to adolescents. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are closely linked to online gambling addiction, as individuals may use gambling as a coping mechanism. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these challenges, with many individuals turning to online gambling for entertainment during lockdowns. To address the growing prevalence of online gambling addiction, comprehensive regulatory frameworks are needed, alongside responsible gambling initiatives and public awareness campaigns. Collaboration among stakeholders, including government agencies, healthcare providers, and gambling operators, is crucial for effective intervention. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of online gambling trends will inform future policies and help identify emerging risks. By adopting a multifaceted approach, Indonesian policymakers and stakeholders can work towards minimizing the risks associated with online gambling and fostering a healthier environment for its citizens.},

The findings reveal that the coverage predominantly features the government, such as "Budi Arie", in a positive role as an active actor in the fight against online gambling (inclusion). The government is portrayed as the key and dominant force in addressing this issue. In contrast, the online gambling perpetrators and victims are more frequently ignored or concealed (exclusion). The perpetrators are depicted as destructive agents responsible for the issue, while victims are often portrayed as suffering individuals who require external intervention. The language use that emphasizes the government's role highlights efforts to reinforce their legitimacy in addressing this social problem.

This study employs a normative legal research method with a descriptive approach, supported by both primary and secondary legal materials. Data will be collected through literature study and analyzed qualitatively.The discussion and conclusion reveal that although the indictment formally meets the requirements under the Criminal Procedure Code (KUHAP), there is inaccuracy in the selection of the legal basis, which is a material requirement. The public prosecutor charged the defendant under Article 303 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP), which is more suitable for conventional gambling, whereas the offense committed would be more appropriately charged under Law Number 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE Law). This inaccuracy potentially leads to legal uncertainty in law enforcement and creates juridical consequences for the indictment.

Court decisions show inconsistencies in applying legal articles to online gambling offenders, despite Article 27 paragraph (2) of the UU ITE clearly governing the distribution of gambling content via electronic systems.

The findings reveal that applying Article 303 KUHP to online gambling fails to reflect the proper application of legal principles.
