abstract = {The rise of online gambling in Indonesia has emerged as a significant public health concern, driven by various psychological, social, and regulatory factors. Despite stringent laws prohibiting gambling, the accessibility and appeal of online platforms have led to increased participation, particularly among young adults. This phenomenon is characterized by a paradoxical sense of control that users feel while gambling online, which can lead to compulsive behaviors and addiction. The structural characteristics of online gambling platforms, including fast-paced games and easy accessibility, further exacerbate this issue. Social influences, particularly through social media and peer interactions, normalize gambling behaviors, making them more appealing to adolescents. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are closely linked to online gambling addiction, as individuals may use gambling as a coping mechanism. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these challenges, with many individuals turning to online gambling for entertainment during lockdowns. To address the growing prevalence of online gambling addiction, comprehensive regulatory frameworks are needed, alongside responsible gambling initiatives and public awareness campaigns. Collaboration among stakeholders, including government agencies, healthcare providers, and gambling operators, is crucial for effective intervention. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of online gambling trends will inform future policies and help identify emerging risks. By adopting a multifaceted approach, Indonesian policymakers and stakeholders can work towards minimizing the risks associated with online gambling and fostering a healthier environment for its citizens.},

The findings reveal that the coverage predominantly features the government, such as "Budi Arie", in a positive role as an active actor in the fight against online gambling (inclusion). The government is portrayed as the key and dominant force in addressing this issue. In contrast, the online gambling perpetrators and victims are more frequently ignored or concealed (exclusion). The perpetrators are depicted as destructive agents responsible for the issue, while victims are often portrayed as suffering individuals who require external intervention. The language use that emphasizes the government's role highlights efforts to reinforce their legitimacy in addressing this social problem. Thus, the analysis shows that Kompas.com's news coverage tends to present a discourse that supports the government's role in tackling online gambling, while minimizing the representation of perpetrators and victims.},

The public prosecutor charged the defendant under Article 303 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP), which is more suitable for conventional gambling, whereas the offense committed would be more appropriately charged under Law Number 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE Law).

abstract = {There are several factors that contribute to the occurrence of online gambling, including economic, environmental, religious, curiosity and the desire to try, as well as perceptions of the chances of winning. This writing uses a qualitative research method, with data collection techniques in the form of library research consisting of books, scientific journals, mass media, the internet, and other references. The results of this study show that the number of divorces due to online gambling has continued to increase over the past five years, from 2020 to 2024. This number increased by 32% in one year and skyrocketed by 142.6%. By mid-2024, the number of divorce cases caused by online gambling had reached 2,000, which caught the attention of the government. In response, several steps have been taken, such as tightening regulations to curb the spread of online gambling, blocking online gambling sites, providing counseling and rehabilitation for those addicted to online gambling, and offering guidance and education for couples, both those preparing for marriage and those already married, about the dangers of online gambling to the harmony of family life},

This research aims to analyze the social, economic and psychological impacts of online gambling in Indonesia through qualitative methods with a case study approach. Data was obtained from various sources, including previous research, reports from related institutions, as well as information found online. The research results show that online gambling addiction has a very significant negative impact and various factors that cause the increase in online gambling addiction include easy access, aggressive promotion of various types of online gambling on the market. Articles related to online gambling are regulated in Law article ITE 27 section 2, but law enforcement still faces many obstacles.

The implications of these findings indicate the need for stricter policy interventions as well as education and rehabilitation programs to reduce the negative impact of online gambling on Indonesian society. Effective methods to help individuals quit online gambling addiction include psychological counseling, social support, and developing stress and emotion management skills.},

abstract = {Currently, online gambling is a phenomenon in itself, especially among students because it is a means to get money instantly through gambling. Some students even make online gambling their main livelihood to fulfill their daily needs. Online gambling among students is a bad habit for the future generation of the Republic of Indonesia because it educates people to earn and earn a living in an unnatural way and forms a lazy person. In fact, in some cases many students use tuition money as capital to play gambling without thinking about the side effects of these actions even though these actions can make them threatened with not being able to pay tuition fees. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that cause students to engage in online gambling. The research is analyzed juridically empirically with primary data and secondary data. The data is collected through literature study and conducting interviews with related parties and data analysis is carried out with descriptive methods and qualitative approaches. Based on the results of the analysis, there are efforts made by the police such as preventive, repressive, curative, and persuasive efforts, unfortunately these efforts have not been able to overcome online gambling among students. The factors that influence the majority of students to engage in online gambling include social and economic factors, situational factors, learning factors, factors of perception of the probability of winning, and factors of perception of skill. Referring to these factors, obstacles that are often found in overcoming online gambling such as students who tend to cover up online gambling problems, students find it difficult to accept advice, always feel right, tend to avoid and cover up activities that cannot be abandoned.},

A descriptive research methodology with a qualitative approach is employed to gain an in-depth understanding of the online gambling addiction behavior prevalent among the adolescent community. The research findings indicate that adolescents have been engaged in online gambling activities since 2021, particularly in the form of pragmatic play. Their primary motivation for playing stems from the substantial profits they initially attain, which subsequently leads them into an addictive cycle of trying to replicate that success. Economic factors play a pivotal role in driving their involvement in online gambling. The perceived impacts of online gambling on adolescents are notably significant, particularly the adverse consequences that push them into debt. The majority of their reasons for incurring debt are fueled by curiosity and the desire to continue trying even after experiencing losses. Furthermore, they are capable of expending a substantial amount of money on online gambling within a single day. Ultimately, these adolescents express a strong desire to cease their online gambling habits due to the substantial and influential impacts it has on their lives.},
