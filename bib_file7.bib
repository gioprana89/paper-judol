abstract = {In adolescence many psychological problems develop and manifest for the first time, e.g depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms refer to an unhappy mood, feeling gloomy, sad, and indecisive. Depressive symptoms are related to adolescents' difficulties in regulating emotions. Someone with poor emotional regulation tends to have difficulty dealing with negative emotions from the stress they experience which then has the potential to increase depressive symptoms. This study aims to examine the difficulties of emotion regulation as a predictor of depressive symptoms in adolescents. The research was conducted using a quantitative method with a cross sectional design and a correlational research type. The participants were 446 adolescents aged 13-17 years, who were obtained by convenience sampling technique. Difficulties of the Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) were used as instrument in this study. The results show that difficulties in emotion regulation predicts depressive symptoms in adolescents. In more detail, the dimensions of lack of awareness, lack of clarity, non acceptable emotional responses, and limited emotion regulation strategies predict depressive symptoms in adolescents. This happens because the lack of awareness, clarity, and limited emotion regulation strategies makes individuals use maladaptive strategies so that adolescents have depressive symptoms. In addition, nonacceptance emotions response makes adolescents feel higher negative affect. Based on these results, it is important for adolescents to get interventions to overcome difficulties in emotion regulation so that they are not prone to experiencing depressive symptoms.},

abstract = {The rise of online gambling in Indonesia has emerged as a significant public health concern, driven by various psychological, social, and regulatory factors. Despite stringent laws prohibiting gambling, the accessibility and appeal of online platforms have led to increased participation, particularly among young adults. This phenomenon is characterized by a paradoxical sense of control that users feel while gambling online, which can lead to compulsive behaviors and addiction. The structural characteristics of online gambling platforms, including fast-paced games and easy accessibility, further exacerbate this issue. Social influences, particularly through social media and peer interactions, normalize gambling behaviors, making them more appealing to adolescents. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are closely linked to online gambling addiction, as individuals may use gambling as a coping mechanism. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these challenges, with many individuals turning to online gambling for entertainment during lockdowns. To address the growing prevalence of online gambling addiction, comprehensive regulatory frameworks are needed, alongside responsible gambling initiatives and public awareness campaigns. Collaboration among stakeholders, including government agencies, healthcare providers, and gambling operators, is crucial for effective intervention. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of online gambling trends will inform future policies and help identify emerging risks. By adopting a multifaceted approach, Indonesian policymakers and stakeholders can work towards minimizing the risks associated with online gambling and fostering a healthier environment for its citizens.},

abstract = {The indictment is a legal document submitted by the public prosecutor in criminal proceedings, serving to explain the criminal offense charged against the defendant. The issue examined in this paper focuses on a juridical review of the inaccurate use of an indictment in the North Jakarta District Court Decision Number 43/PID.B/2021/PN JKT.UTR concerning an online gambling offense. This study employs a normative legal research method with a descriptive approach, supported by both primary and secondary legal materials. Data will be collected through literature study and analyzed qualitatively.The discussion and conclusion reveal that although the indictment formally meets the requirements under the Criminal Procedure Code (KUHAP), there is inaccuracy in the selection of the legal basis, which is a material requirement. The public prosecutor charged the defendant under Article 303 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP), which is more suitable for conventional gambling, whereas the offense committed would be more appropriately charged under Law Number 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE Law). This inaccuracy potentially leads to legal uncertainty in law enforcement and creates juridical consequences for the indictment. This study emphasizes the importance of precision in formulating indictments.},

abstract = {This research examines legal certainty in handling online gambling cases under Article 303 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP) and Article 27 paragraph (2) of the Electronic Information and Transactions Law (UU ITE). The widespread growth of internet-based gambling highlights the need to apply the legal principle of lex specialis derogat legi generali, whereby special provisions override general ones when regulating the same conduct. Court decisions show inconsistencies in applying legal articles to online gambling offenders, despite Article 27 paragraph (2) of the UU ITE clearly governing the distribution of gambling content via electronic systems. This normative legal research applies three approaches: statutory, conceptual, and case approach. The findings reveal that applying Article 303 KUHP to online gambling fails to reflect the proper application of legal principles. Consequently, legal practitioners must enhance their understanding and boldness in prioritizing lex specialis to ensure legal certainty in the digital era},

abstract = {This study aims to describe the inclusion and exclusion of social actors in online gambling news coverage on Kompas.com using a critical discourse analysis approach assisted by corpora. By utilizing this approach, the language patterns used in the coverage are systematically analyzed to explore how the issue of online gambling is framed by the media. The findings reveal that the coverage predominantly features the government, such as "Budi Arie", in a positive role as an active actor in the fight against online gambling (inclusion). The government is portrayed as the key and dominant force in addressing this issue. In contrast, the online gambling perpetrators and victims are more frequently ignored or concealed (exclusion). The perpetrators are depicted as destructive agents responsible for the issue, while victims are often portrayed as suffering individuals who require external intervention. The language use that emphasizes the government's role highlights efforts to reinforce their legitimacy in addressing this social problem. Thus, the analysis shows that Kompas.com's news coverage tends to present a discourse that supports the government's role in tackling online gambling, while minimizing the representation of perpetrators and victims.},

abstract = {Alcohol use is linked to several negative physical, psychological and social consequences, making it a significant global health issue. This study aims to focus on the factors and patterns of alcohol consumption among adults in the West Bank of Palestine, as well as its association with hazardous behaviors.A cross-sectional survey including 1,043 adult Palestinians aged 18–69 years in the West Bank was conducted between July and September 2024. A proportional stratified sampling method was used in the northern, central and southern regions of the West Bank. An online self-administered survey included sociodemographic data; the AUDIT criteria for diagnosing alcohol use disorder; alcohol-related risk behaviors, including substance use, violence and gambling; and inquiries regarding adult alcohol consumption, motivations, barriers and reinforcers.Overall, 5.75\% reported being alcohol users, with a higher prevalence among males (7.57\%) than females (3.46\%) (p = 0.005). Among current users, 75\% engaged in binge drinking at least once, whereas 18.2\% exhibited severe-moderate alcohol dependence. The data revealed that high-risk behaviors were associated with alcohol use. Compared with nonusers, a substantial 68.3\% of alcohol users smoke cigarettes, 70\% consume energy drinks, 30\% engage in violent activities and 23.3\% use illicit drugs (p \< 0.05).This study has several limitations that should be addressed. First, relying on self-reported data may have introduced some bias. The participants might have downplayed or overstated their alcohol use and risky behaviors, possibly because of memory gaps or wanting to present themselves in a certain way. Additionally, as this is a cross-sectional study, it captures only a single point in time, giving us a snapshot of alcohol consumption but not enough to understand how drinking habits and risky behaviors influence each other over time. This limits our ability to determine the causes and effects of alcohol use and related behaviors. The cultural stigma surrounding alcohol in Palestinian society may have also led to underreporting, as participants feared social consequences. Longitudinal data are needed to understand the long-term effects of alcohol consumption and dependency on or tracking changes in alcohol consumption patterns. Future studies would benefit from incorporating longitudinal designs and more in-depth qualitative research to explore these issues better in the Palestinian context.The strength of this study lies in its pioneering nature as the first comprehensive investigation into the epidemiology of alcohol consumption and its association with risky behaviors among young adults in Palestine. By addressing this critical public health issue within a cultural context that traditionally stigmatizes alcohol use, this research provides valuable insights into the prevalence of alcohol use, motivations for alcohol consumption and associated risks specific to the Palestinian population. This foundational work highlights the urgent need for awareness and intervention strategies. It serves as a crucial reference point for future research and public health initiatives to address alcohol-related issues in the region.This study's findings highlight the urgent need for public health programs to expand treatment access, decrease stigma and obtain a better understanding of the variables that impact alcohol consumption.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of online gambling has become a serious problem in various regions, including West Aceh Regency. data on cases handled by the West Aceh District Syar'iyah Court in the period 2021 to 2024 shows a significant increase in cases. Online gambling as part of jarimah maisir has different characteristics from conventional forms of gambling, namely digital, hidden, cross-regional, and difficult to detect by the naked eye by law enforcement officials and the general public. The problems in this study are How is the application of qanun jinayat law against online gambling offenders in the jurisdiction of the West Aceh District Syar'iyah Court, What are the obstacles faced in applying the law to online gambling offenders based on qanun jinayat law, and What are the efforts to prevent online gambling violations in the West Aceh area. This research uses empirical legal methods with a field research approach and case studies. The results showed that the application of Aceh Qanun Number 6 of 2014 concerning Jinayat Law against online gambling offenders was in accordance with the procedures of jinayat law, but its implementation was still not optimal. The Syar'iyah Court has handled a number of cases, but the number is not proportional to the potential violations. The main obstacles include limited regional authority in blocking sites, lack of digital forensic experts, absence of district-level cyber units, and weak coordination between agencies. Prevention is carried out through digital education by DISKOMINSA, thematic dakwah by the Islamic Sharia Office, as well as the Gampong Tolak Judi Online programme involving the community and the formation of the Gampong Pageu Task Force.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare the effectiveness of sanctions under the ITE Law and jarimah ta'zir in addressing online gambling, and to explore how the integration of these approaches can create a more effective and comprehensive legal framework in Indonesia. This study employs a normative juridical method with an analytical approach to relevant laws and regulations, particularly the ITE Law and Qanun Jinayat in Aceh. Data were analyzed through a comparative evaluation of sanctions under the ITE Law and jarimah ta'zir, focusing on their effectiveness in tackling technological challenges, reducing recidivism, and creating social deterrence against online gambling. The findings reveal that the ITE Law, while effective in utilizing technological measures such as website blocking and account monitoring, faces limitations in providing a permanent deterrent due to the adaptability of gambling networks through VPNs, cryptocurrency, and domain migration. On the other hand, jarimah ta'zir, as implemented in Aceh, demonstrates significant success in reducing online gambling cases, with a recorded 35% decrease in cases in 2022, and a 10.53% decrease in overall criminal cases in Aceh Jaya in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to public punishments like caning, which create stronger social stigma and moral deterrence. Furthermore, the rehabilitative aspect of jarimah ta'zir offers a complementary approach to the punitive nature of the ITE Law, addressing the underlying causes of gambling behavior.},

The analysis phase starts with data gathering or crawling, followed by data labeling, data preprocessing, and ultimately method categorization. The dataset comprises 2,866 tweets, with 1,436 classified as positive (50.12%) and 1,429 as negative (49.88%). The data before to the classification process is partitioned into training data and testing data, including 70% training data and 30% testing data. The analysis with the SVM approach yielded a classification accuracy of 83%, whereas the na{\"{i}}ve Bayes method achieved just 79%. Upon completion of the method classification process, the subsequent phase involves visualization and assessment. During the visualization step, bar plots, word clouds, and word frequencies derived from sentiment analysis calculations are shown, alongside a visualization of words from the dataset. The investigation indicates that the SVM approach outperforms Naive Bayes in sentiment classification. The benefit of SVM resides in its capability to manage data with elevated limits and accuracy, enhancing its efficiency in discerning positive and negative thoughts. The findings of this study demonstrate that SVM is better appropriate for data exhibiting complicated distributions, whereas the Naive Bayes approach yields suboptimal results. Thus, SVM can be proposed as a more appropriate and reliable approach for similar sentiment analysis in the future.},

abstract = {This study aims to compare the effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms in detecting Indonesian-language online gambling websites. With the increasing number of online gambling players in Indonesia, it is essential to develop effective methods for identifying gambling content. The dataset used consists of 34,336 gambling websites and 36,529 non-gambling websites, collected through web scraping. The SVM model demonstrated an accuracy of 99%, with evaluation metrics including a precision of 1.00, recall of 0.99, and F1-score of 0.99. In contrast, the CNN model achieved perfect accuracy of 100%, with precision, recall, and F1-score all at 1.00. However, it is important to note that this perfect accuracy was achieved under certain conditions, including a relatively clean dataset and optimal training processes. Evaluation results using cross-validation techniques indicated that SVM maintained a consistent accuracy of approximately 99%, while CNN exhibited an average accuracy of 99.61% with a very low standard deviation. This research emphasizes the importance of data pre-processing in enhancing model accuracy and highlights the advantages of CNN in capturing complex patterns within text. These findings contribute significantly to the development of detection methods for online gambling websites in Indonesia and open avenues for further research in this field.},

The method used is corpus-based critical discourse analysis, which allows systematic exploration of news data to identify language patterns that frame the issue of online gambling. The analysis was conducted on a news corpus containing 5613 words and 43042 tokens using the AntConc application. The results show that the words “gambling” and “online” have the highest frequency, signaling the main focus on this phenomenon. The dominant social actors are government officials, such as “Budi Arie,” who is portrayed positively as a pioneer in eradicating online gambling, while online gambling perpetrators are portrayed destructively. Victims are seen as suffering and in need of external intervention. The social actions represented highlight the government's efforts to eradicate online gambling, with word choices that emphasize the urgency of handling this problem. Kompas.com frames the issue of online gambling by strengthening the role of the government as a protector, the perpetrator as a public enemy, and the victim as a party that needs to be saved. This study implies that online mass media play an important role in shaping public discourse, emphasizing the legal and moral sides, and introducing various perspectives that frame this issue.},

This research aims to identify critical actors, interaction patterns, and how information about online gambling is distributed among YouTube users. Drawing on social media network analysis (SNA), the study analyzes data collected from 3,673 unique user accounts and their corresponding comments and replies using Communalytic.org and analyzed using Gephi software. The results showed 3,110 nodes and 424 edges with a diameter value of 2, density of 0, reciprocity of 0, and centralization of 0.00001, depicting a decentralized communication network with minimal and one-way interactions. Key actors like @wanwan6171 and @diditsamodra have significantly influenced this network. These findings affirm the critical role of social media in disseminating information and shaping public opinion on complex social issues such as online gambling. This study highlights the limitations of social-mediated communication in fostering meaningful discussions on complex issues like online gambling. While social media serves as a platform for opinion expression, the lack of interaction suggests that it functions more as a broadcast medium rather than a deliberative public sphere. These insights can help policymakers and social media platforms design strategies for more effective digital discourse and online gambling awareness campaigns.},

This study aims to explore and analyze the impact of online gambling addiction on marital relationships, with a focus on the causes leading to divorce. Employing a qualitative research approach, data were gathered through in-depth interviews with individuals and couples who had experienced divorce as a direct consequence of one partner's online gambling behavior. The results of this study reveal that online gambling addiction significantly contributes to financial instability, emotional distance, repeated conflicts, and the eventual breakdown of communication and trust within the relationship. Many participants reported experiencing feelings of betrayal, frustration, and emotional exhaustion due to the compulsive gambling behavior of their partners. In several cases, gambling debts resulted in the sale of family assets and prolonged financial insecurity, which further strained the relationship. Moreover, the secrecy surrounding gambling activities often led to the erosion of mutual respect and transparency between spouses. This research underscores the urgent need for public education and policy intervention to mitigate the negative effects of online gambling on families. Support systems such as counseling, rehabilitation programs, and financial planning services are crucial to help affected individuals recover and rebuild their lives. By shedding light on the destructive nature of online gambling on family dynamics, this study aims to contribute to the broader discourse on mental health, addiction, and the preservation of marital stability in the digital age.},
